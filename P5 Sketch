P5 Sketch Attached!

What was challenging for you during this process?

I definetly think that the most challenging part of this process was being able to fully write out everything I needed, along with the flag. I especially think that the flag
I drew on top was the most challenging but fun part of the process on making a sketch. 

What makes more sense now than it did before you started?

I am more confident now on how to properly draw and where each cordinate point would go. At first I would struggle to properly draw each sketch, but now I am fully confident

What are you proud of?

Everything I was able to achieve, and most importantly, the flag!
